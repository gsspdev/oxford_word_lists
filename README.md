# Oxford American English Word Lists

## Collections of Common English Words (via Oxford)

## Includes:
- Oxford 3000 American English Words [0-3000]
- Oxford 5000 American English Words [3001-5000] (2000 Additional Words)
- Oxford 5000 American English Words (Full) [0-5000]

### Note: The first two lists are preserved in their original form.
### Confusingly the Oxford 5000 contains only 2000 words as it's
### intended as a supplement to the Oxford 3000. As this is probably
### not useful to most programmers, I have included a combined list
### containing all 5000 words.
