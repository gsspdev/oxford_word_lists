# Oxford American English Word Lists

## Collections of Common English Words (via Oxford)

## Includes:
- Oxford 3000 American English Words [0-3000]
- Oxford 5000 American English Words [3001-5000] (2000 Additional Words)
- Oxford 5000 American English Words (Full) [0-5000]

## Formatting:
### Each 'word'* is seperated by a new line
### *Each line may actually contain multiple Words
### They may also contain parenthesis to distinguish definitions
### Review the lists before using them in your projects

#### Note: Noterst two lists are preserved in their original form.
#### Confusingly the Oxford 5000 contains only 2000 words as it's
#### intended as a supplement to the Oxford 3000. As this is probably
#### not useful to most programmers, I have included a combined list
#### containing all 5000 words.
